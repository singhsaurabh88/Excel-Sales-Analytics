# Excel: Sales-Analytics (FMCG Domain)

In this project, I crafted a comprehensive sales report with Excel pivot tables, enabling businesses to analyze customer discounts, negotiate effectively, and pinpoint expansion opportunities. The reports offer actionable insights, optimizing sales strategies, boosting customer satisfaction, and maximizing revenue.

Proficiency was acquired in pivotal areas: pivot tables, Power Query, DAX Basics, conditional formatting, report beautification, and sales domain metrics.
In summary, the project's objective is to empower businesses with tools for monitoring, evaluating, and enhancing sales activities. Leveraging sales data analysis enables unlocking opportunities, driving growth, and maintaining competitiveness in the dynamic market landscape.

I created two detailed reports (sales report and Finance report) specifically for the sales team. These reports not only help them assess customer performance but also offer valuable insights into market dynamics. This facilitates a clear understanding of overall market performance in relation to predefined targets and goals.

Along with this additional analysis were also performed to get insights from both sales report and finance report. These analysis were related to New Product Launch 2021,Top 5 and Bottom 5 Products sold by quantity,Top 5 countries by Net Sales 2021, Top 10 Products by Year, P & L report by Division, P&L report by Region/Market.
